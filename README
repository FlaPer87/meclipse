How to install?

An update site is on the way - check back soon!

What does Meclipse do???

* It has a MongoDB View that contains a list of servers (connections). It is possible to add/remove connections. They are saved in a settings file.
* It loads (as TreeView) the list of databases and collections.
 * View stats about databases and collections in Eclipse Properties View
 * View serverStatus() output in Eclipse Properties View
 * Set the profiling level for any given database
* It loads the data found in the collection. To do this, Meclipse opens a new Editor and shows the data loaded (This part needs a lot of work).

What does it look like???

Here's a shot of the DB view:

TODO:
* Meclipse already shows the connections, databases, collections and data stored in MongoDB so I think that the critical point (where I'm/you're/we're should focus ) is how data is shown in the editor.
* Many other things.
* Update this README :)
