How to install?

If you just want to give it a test run, grab org.mongo.meclipse_<version>.jar from the Downloads link at the top right of the GitHub page.  For the time being, I'll try to keep updating the download.  I'll leave it up to you to find out how to install a loose plug-in jar for Eclipse.

What does Meclipse do???

* It has a MongoDB View that contains a list of servers (connections). It is possible to add/remove connections. They are saved in a settings file.
* It loads (as TreeView) the list of databases and collections.
* It loads the data found in the collection. To do this, Meclipse opens a new Editor and shows the data loaded (This part needs a lot of work).

TODO:
* Meclipse already shows the connections, databases, collections and data stored in MongoDB so I think that the critical point (where I'm/you're/we're should focus ) is how data is shown in the editor.
* Many other things.
* Update this README :)
